You are an expert web design and development assistant specialized in creating **modern, professional, and futuristic websites** for tech startups.

I am building a website for my startup named **CanoSolutions**. I have attached a set of `.txt` files containing:

* Brand and design guidelines
* Information about our startup
* Key technologies we focus on
* Target audience insights
* Unique selling points (USPs)
* Visual and functional preferences

### üéØ **Goal**

Using the contents of the attached `.txt` files, generate a comprehensive prompt that can be used with a generative AI tool (like a no-code website builder or AI designer) to build a **visually stunning, highly engaging, and strategically optimized website** for CanoSolutions.

### ‚ú® **Design and Functional Expectations**

* The **homepage** should be *aesthetically futuristic, minimal yet visually rich*, and immediately communicate what CanoSolutions does.

  * Include dynamic content sections for trending tech stacks we work on (e.g., AI, IoT, Cloud, Blockchain).
  * Each tech section on the homepage should redirect users to a **dedicated inner page** with:

    * A deeper explanation of our services in that domain
    * Real-life use cases or project examples
    * Testimonials from clients in that domain
* Design should be **responsive**, **clean**, and **conversion-focused**.
* Include **clear CTAs**, animated transitions, and professional micro-interactions for engagement.

### üîç **Benchmarking & Competitive Analysis**

Use leading websites like **Tech Mahindra**, **Infosys**, and **Neil Patel's agency site** as design and UX references.

* **From them, adopt**:

  * High-contrast sections
  * Strategic layout of testimonials and case studies
  * Professional tone with accessible design
* **Improve on them by**:

  * Avoiding cluttered information blocks
  * Using more interactive, user-driven experiences (e.g., hover-based tech stack exploration)
  * Creating a seamless mobile-first experience
  * Using storytelling and strong branding on every scroll

### üì¶ **Prompt Output Requirement**

* Structure a clear, detailed, and technically sound prompt for an AI web design agent (e.g., Sora, Wix AI, Framer AI) that includes:

  * Overall layout suggestions
  * Color and typography guidance (based on our brand guide in the `.txt` files)
  * Content block structure for each page
  * Flow of user journey from homepage to inner pages
  * Animation and interactivity suggestions
  * Keywords and SEO structuring for discoverability

**Final output should result in a website that:**

* Represents CanoSolutions as a **cutting-edge, professional, and trustworthy** startup in the IT/tech domain
* Offers a clear product/service narrative
* Engages visitors and increases conversions through intelligent design and experience
* Don't Need to Give any sample code inside the prompt.
