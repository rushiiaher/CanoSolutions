What To DO in the Prompt (Essentials for a Futuristic, Aesthetic, and Professional Website):
Design Language:

Use a minimalistic and clean UI.

Follow a modern grid layout with proper spacing and alignment.

Emphasize flat design or neumorphism with subtle shadows.

Color Palette:

Stick to a monotone or duotone color scheme.

Prefer neutral tones (like #111, #222, #e0e0e0) with 1–2 accent colors.

Example: black, white, gray, with one accent like blue or green.

Typography:

Use only professional fonts (e.g., Inter, IBM Plex Sans, Roboto, Open Sans).

Avoid fancy or playful fonts.

Ensure good readability and hierarchy (heading size difference, weight).

Components:

Ask for essential UI components: navbar, hero section, service cards, contact form, CTA buttons.

Include clean icons (Lucide, Tabler, Material), not emojis.

Overall Vibe:

Ask for a sleek, corporate, and tech-forward aesthetic.

Use phrases like:

“modern and corporate”

“clean and professional”

“suitable for a tech company or IT consultancy”

Content Structure:

Prioritize clarity and simplicity in text blocks.

Ensure each section communicates a purpose (services, benefits, testimonials, contact, about).

Accessibility:

Ask for accessible color contrasts and responsive layouts.

❌ What NOT To Do in the Prompt (Avoid These Pitfalls):
No Gradients Everywhere:

Say "Avoid excessive color gradients on text or buttons."

Gradients should be minimal or subtle if used at all.

No Emojis or Decorative Icons:

Add: "Do not use emojis in any text or heading."

Use clean line icons instead.

No Overused Trendy Effects:

Avoid glassmorphism, glitch effects, bouncing animations, neon borders, etc.

Say: "Avoid funky, trendy, or over-animated elements."

No Fancy Fonts or Comic Style:

Avoid cursive, comic sans, handwritten, or bubbly fonts.

Say: "Use only clean, readable sans-serif fonts suitable for professional use."

No Overcrowded Layouts:

Say: "Keep layout breathable with enough white space."

Avoid cramming cards, buttons, or content too tightly.

No Multi-color Buttons or Cards:

Ask for single-color buttons with subtle hover effects.

Say: "Each component should use a single color with slight shadow or border on hover."
